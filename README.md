# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election passed on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Sources: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.65.0

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham receieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.  
  - Diana DeGette receieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.  
  - Raymon Anthony Doane receieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.  
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette , who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose

Using the [tabulated results](/Resources/election_results.csv) of a recent US congressional precinct election in Colorado, we were able to help Seth and Tom complete the election audit and generate a vote count report to certify this US congressional race. This vote count report includes the total number of votes cast, the total number and percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Now the election commission has requested some additioal data to complete the audit:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total county
3. The county with the highest turnout

## Election Audit Results

To generate the additional county voter turnout results, we used [Python](/PyPoll_Challenge.py) to write the algorithms that assisted the confirmation and analysis of the election results. Figure 1 displays the following [analysis](/Analysis/election_analysis.txt) of the election results:

- There were 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election.

- The county results in the precinct were:
  - Jefferson County had 10.5% of the total vote and 38,855 number of votes.  
  - Denver County had 82.8% of the total vote and 306,055 number of votes.  
  - Arapahoe County had 6.7% of the total vote and 24,801 number of votes. 

- The county with the largest voter turnout was:
  - Denver , with 82.8% of the total vote and 306,055 number of votes.

- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham receieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.  
  - Diana DeGette receieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.  
  - Raymon Anthony Doane receieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes. 

- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette , who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Election Audit Summary

In summary, this executed Python script facilitated a modular approach to verify expected election results piecemeal. Since scripts are highly extensible and can be easily amended, similar figures for any election can be generated by modifying this script. For instance, we would be able to produce a comparable report of the overall voter count and by county for any other election based on popular vote in any level of government by using a dataset with the equivalent information (i.e., ballot ID, county, candidate) for a different voter population. Since a candidate's success is determined by voter turnout and behavior, further inspection of data relevant to the voters, such as age, gender, education, and religion, may reveal similar voter characteristics in successful election outcomes. Assuming these voter demographic data is available for analysis, we could provide, for example, a breakdown of the number of votes by age group and the percentage of votes received for each candidate by age group.
